  AFFECTS: users of mesa based ports (libGL etc) and xorg-server.
  AUTHOR: x11@FreeBSD.org

  Update default mesa (libGL and friends) to 7.6.1 and xorg-server to 1.7.7.
  Add a new switch WITH_NEW_XORG, for people that want mesa 7.11.x and
  xorg-server 1.10.4, this will also update xf86-video-intel to the version
  that only supports KMS. If you FreeBSD version doesn't have KMS then you
  shouldn't use the WITH_NEW_XORG macro on machines with intel graphics.
  Supported versions of FreeBSD with KMS kernel support:
  10.0-Current with a patch

  When switching xorg-server versions make sure to rebuild your xf86-* ports.

  Mention acceleration issues with KDE and 1.10.x. Nvidia shouldn't have any
  problems. Ati should work, but acceleration might be botched. 
  The nouveau driver is sadly a casualty, it needs to be updated and kernel
  support needs to be written. Other rarer drivers aren't tested.
