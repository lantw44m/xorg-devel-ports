  If libGL is version 7.6.x or dri is version 7.6.x or 8.0 are install and
  the user is updating to 9.x.x, then the user needs to remove libGL and dri
  prior to updating. Updating libGL from 8.x to 9.x should be without a problem.

  # pkg_delete -f libGL-\* dri-\*
  or
  # pkg delete -f libGL dri
