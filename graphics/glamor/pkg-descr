The glamor module is an open-source 2D graphics common driver for the 
X Window System as implemented by X.org. It supports a variety of graphics
chipsets which have OpenGL/EGL/GBM supports.

It's a GL-based rendering acceleration library for X server:

    It uses GL functions and shader to complete the 2D graphics operations.
    It uses normal texture to represent a drawable pixmap if possible.

    It calls GL functions to render to the texture directly. It's somehow
    hardware independently. And could be a building block of any X server's
    DDX driver:

    Xorg's DDX driver could leverage glamor-egl package to create an egl
    context without any native X system. Now the xf86-intel-video driver
    uses glamor as one of its option. When you build it with --enable-glamor,
    then it will use glamor as its rendering enginee. This package can support
    every platform which has OpenGL and gbm and drm libraries.

From the 0.6.0 release notes:
Considering that glamor has been merged into xorg, this release may be the
last major one for the external glamor project. All major feature enhancement
or performance improvement should go to the in tree glamor project, rather
than here. But bug fixing and minor feature enhancement will always be
welcome here as long as there are some one still using this standalone library.
